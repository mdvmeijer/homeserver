# Introduction

This project comprises an Ansible playbook for provisioning a freshly installed Ubuntu 21.10 system for use of Nextcloud.

# Vagrant
The included Vagrant configuration is meant for testing. It is a representation of the physical system on which this Ansible project will be used in practice.
In order to start the Vagrant VM, run `vagrant up` in the root folder of this project. After the VM has been provisioned, run `vagrant ssh` to get a shell.
